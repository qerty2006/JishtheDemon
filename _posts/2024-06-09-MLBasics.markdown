Today, I'll be trying to explain the very basics of a neural network, in a way that a high school calculus student with almost no computer science background would be able to understand it as: an optimization problem.

So a neural network is a multivariable function that returns a multivariable answer. How it does that is what I will first explain.

In order to create the neural network, we need to know what problem we are trying to solve; for machine learning models, the starting point is recognizing handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset][dataset]

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
```
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
